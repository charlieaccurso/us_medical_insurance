# us_medical_insurance

In this project, we will be using a U.S. Medical Insurance dataset to answer the following questions:

How many patients are there by age group?
What is the average age of the patients in the dataset?
Where are a majority of the individuals from?
How do average costs differ between smokers vs. non-smokers?
What is the average age for someone who has at least one child in this dataset?
